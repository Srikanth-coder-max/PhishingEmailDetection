# Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements **two approaches** for phishing email detection:

### ML-Based Approach
- Uses traditional **Machine Learning algorithms** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
- Extracts features like **email headers, content analysis, and metadata**.

### DL-Based Approach 
- Uses **Deep Learning models** (e.g., LSTMs, CNNs) for text-based email classification.
- Leverages **word embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT)** for email analysis.

##  Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Srikanth-coder-max/PhishingEmailDetection.git
cd PhishingEmailDetection
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

### 4️⃣ Open and execute the notebook (.ipynb)

##  Models & Techniques Used
-  Feature Engineering: Email metadata, text features
-  Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
-  Deep Learning Models: LSTM, CNN, Transformers (if used)
-  Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

##  Results & Insights
- The **ML-based model** performs well with structured data.
- The **DL-based model** excels in analyzing textual content.
- Combining both approaches can further improve phishing detection accuracy.

##  Future Improvements
-  Fine-tune Deep Learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
-  Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit Web App
-  Integrate real-time email classification
